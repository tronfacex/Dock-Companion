Dock Companion is a small Windows console application I built using two blocks of code from StackOverflow and a conversation with <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"> OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>.

<strong>Note:</strong> I found that working with ChatGPT greatly accelerated my development time. I have not worked on many non-Unity based C# projects, so my lack of familiarty with the System namespaces and DLLImports would have been an early blocker. I was very impressed with ChatGPT's ability to evaluate my code and my goals, and offer multiple solutions to each issue along the way.
